## Are you creating an issue in the correct repository?

- This repository is for the Jasmine docs. If you aren't reporting a documentation problem, you're probabl in the wrong place.
- When in doubt, create an issue in the [core Jasmine repo](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/issues).
- If you are using a test runner that wraps Jasmine, consider filing an issue with that library if appropriate:
  - [Jasmine npm](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/issues)
  - [Jasmine gem](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-gem/issues)
  - [Jasmine py](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-py/issues)
  - [Gulp Jasmine Browser](https://github.com/jasmine/gulp-jasmine-browser/issues)
  - [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues)
  - [Grunt Contrib Jasmine](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jasmine/issues)
