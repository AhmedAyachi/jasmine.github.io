question: When is the next release of Jasmine?
slug: next-release
---

That depends on the pace of contributions and the availability of maintainer
time.

Jasmine is entirely a volunteer effort, which makes it difficult to predict when
releases will come out and impossible to commit to a timeline. In the past,
releases containing new features have usually come out every 1-6 months. When
new bugs are found, we try to release a fix as quickly as possible.
