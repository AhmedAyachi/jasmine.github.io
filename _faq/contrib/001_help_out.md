Thanks for your help! The Jasmine team only has limited time to work on Jasmine so we appreciate all the help we get from the community.

#### Github Issues
When github issues are reported that seem like things Jasmine could support, we will label the issue with "help needed".
This label means that we believe there is enough information included in the conversation for someone to implement on their own.
(We're not always correct. If you have further questions, please ask).

* [jasmine-Core](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/labels/help%20needed)
* [jasmine-npm](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/labels/help%20needed)
* [jasmine-browser-runner](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-browser/labels/help%20needed)
* [jasmine-ajax](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-ajax/labels/help%20needed)
* [documentation (this site)](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine.github.io/labels/help%20needed)

#### Pivotal Tracker
We have a [backlog in Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/10606) that contains work the Jasmine team wants to get into Jasmine.
Look at the top of the current iteration or backlog column for the prioritized list of functionality.
Unfortunately, Tracker doesn't have a great way to allow for comments and questions on a story for people who aren't already joined into the project.
Hopefully the stories are mostly self-explanatory. If not, please ask a question in the associated github issue (if any), or on the [developers list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jasmine-js-dev).
