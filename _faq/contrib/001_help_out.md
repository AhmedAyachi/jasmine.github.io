Thanks for your help! The Jasmine team only has limited time to work on Jasmine so we appreciate all the help we get from the community.

#### Github Issues
When github issues are reported that seem like things Jasmine could support, we will label the issue with "help needed".
This label means that we believe there is enough information included in the conversation for someone to implement on their own.
(We're not always correct. If you have further questions, please ask).

* [jasmine-Core](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/labels/help%20needed)
* [jasmine-npm](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/labels/help%20needed)
* [jasmine-browser-runner](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-browser/labels/help%20needed)
* [jasmine-ajax](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-ajax/labels/help%20needed)
* [documentation (this site)](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine.github.io/labels/help%20needed)

#### New Ideas

Do you have an idea that's not already captured in a GitHub issue? Feel free to
propose it. We recommend (but don't require) that you open an issue to discuss
your idea before submitting a pull request. We don't say yes to every proposal,
so it's best to ask before you put in a lot of work.
